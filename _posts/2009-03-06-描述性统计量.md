The most important things to pay attention to here are row 1 (Mean), row 3 (Sum), and row 10 (N of Obs). 



The Sum is the number of ties present in the matrix (you can confirm this by counting the “1” values or by counting the ties in the sociogram). 



In row 10 of the table, N of Obs is the number of possible ties in the matrix. With four actors there are 12 possible ties [computed by the formula: n (n-1)]. 



The Mean value found in the first row is the density (see Scott Pg. 71) of the matrix. This is simply the number of ties present (found in the Sum row) divided by the number of ties possible (found in the N of Obs row). In this case, density = 100% as every possible tie is indeed present.

Keep in mind that the more obscure and long the keyword, the less point (traffic) there will be in achieving a ranking, for the most part. 



 



This is why SEOs that sell their services “by the keyword” are doing something strange. What keywords? How many people are trying to rank for these keywords, and what kind of traffic can you expect from success? That said, a good SEO might be able to generate lots of traffic through a large list of longtail keywords that produce large traffic in accumulation.



 



Traffic comes from people. How many search engines do you or anyone else you know use?



 



Links are valuable when they come from relevant sources.



 



七点，表示不是个好的seo：



Unclear or Poor Keyword Targets

Insufficient Reporting

Keyword Density Emphasis

Search Engine Submission Emphasis

Directory Submission Emphasis

Retainer Abuse

Information Hoarding
